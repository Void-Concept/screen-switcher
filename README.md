# Screen Switcher

This is a small tool I've built for some streaming I'm potentially going to be doing. I've been thinking about doing some personal programming projects recently, and streaming the process. I currently have 3 monitors and would like to use them all when programming, but that'd be hard to show on stream. My solution is this project; detect if my mouse moves into a different screen and trigger a hotkey to switch screens on StreamLabs. This way I'm able to go off into Chrome too Google stuff and allow others to see what I'm seeing.
